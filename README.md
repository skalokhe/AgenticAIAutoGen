**Developed multi-agent AI systems using AutoGen framework** with specialized agents for database operations, API testing, web automation, and file management

**Built autonomous agent collaboration workflows** implementing RoundRobinGroupChat coordination and UserProxy patterns for human-AI interaction

**Implemented MCP (Model Context Protocol)** for seamless communication between AI agents and external tools including MySQL databases, REST APIs, and Excel spreadsheets

**Created end-to-end automated processes using Database Agent**, API Agent, Browser Automation Agent, and Excel Agent for complete workflow automation without human intervention

Applied context engineering techniques to optimize AI agent performance and implemented state saving mechanisms for persistent agent memory

Designed Agent Factory patterns for building reusable, generic AI agents with configuration-driven context feeding and scalable architecture

Worked with advanced agent orchestration including MultimodalWebSurfer for visual web navigation and SelectorGroupChat for dynamic agent selection

Implemented assertion-based validation for multi-agent system testing and result verification in autonomous workflows
